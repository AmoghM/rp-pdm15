# Practical Data Mining

Week 2: TBD

The last aspect of this first session will introduce regression, in
which we determine a model that can represent a subset of the data of
interest. A model allows us to more quickly make predictions on future,
unseen, data as well as new insights into the data of interest.
Specifically, we will focus on linear regression by using the
scikit_learn library.
