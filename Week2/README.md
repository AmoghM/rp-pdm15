# Practical Data Mining

Week 2: Introduction to Data Analysis

This week, we will first introduce regression, in which we determine a
model that can represent a subset of the data of interest. A model
allows us to more quickly make predictions on future, unseen, data as
well as new insights into the data of interest. Specifically, we will
focus on linear regression by using the scikit_learn and statsmodel
libraries. 

Next we explore two approaches to exploring large data. First we look at
the Dask library that supports out-of-core data processing. Finally, we
introduce the Spark data processing framework and demonstrate how we can
interact with a Spark cluster from within an IPython Notebook.
