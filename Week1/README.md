# Practical Data Mining

Week 1: Introduction to Data Exploration and Regression

In this first class session, we will first ensure everyone is able to
work with a JupyterHub server and can interactively work within the
course IPython Notebooks. We will next review the course cloud computing
setup, and techniques to work with the course material on a personal
laptop.

Next, we will discuss how to approach a particular data problem. We will
begin by exploring the data at the Unix command line, before using an
IPython Notebook and the Pandas library to interactively explore data.
Next we will introduce newer approaches that provide improved
performance with large datasets. We will conclude this part of the first
course with some example visualizations that can guide subsequent data
analyses.

The last aspect of this first session will introduce regression, in
which we determine a model that can represent a subset of the data of
interest. A model allows us to more quickly make predictions on future,
unseen, data as well as new insights into the data of interest.
Specifically, we will focus on linear regression by using the
scikit_learn library.
