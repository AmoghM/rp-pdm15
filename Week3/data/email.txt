Subject: [Instr Note] New Docker Course Image

Instructor Robert J. Brunner posted a new Note. 

New Docker Course Image

We generated a new Docker course image. If you want to follow along on your laptop or work on the course Notebooks offline, you should download this new image by issuing aÂ 

docker pull lcdm/rppdm-standalone
command at a Docker prompt (i.e., in a Docker Quickstart Terminal). On the other hand, if you simply use the JupyterHub Server, no action is required on your part (we have already updated the server).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Robert
