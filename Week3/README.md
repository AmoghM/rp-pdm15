# Practical Data Mining

Week 3: Introduction to Text Data Processing

This week we will start by introducing MongoDB, a NoSQL data storage
technology that was developed to store and process large numbers of
documents. Next, we will develop a Twitter application, including
authentication, that allows us to obtain and process tweets. We will
also explore coupling the Twitter application to a MongoDB to archive
tweets for later processing.

Finally, we will explore different Python text processing techniques
including `string` functionality, regular expressions, and specific
parsing techniques that can handle email and xml documents.
