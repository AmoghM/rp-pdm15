    "\n",
    "Learn how to conduct introductory text mining, beginning with document\n",
    "tokenization that produces a vocabulary that can be used to construct a\n",
    "_bag of words_. Next learn about the Naive Bayes classifier, and how it\n",
    "can be used to quickly classify documents based on a vocabulary. Finally,\n",
    "learn about quantifying classifier performance before also learning\n",
    "about _stop words_, and sparse matrices, and n-grams.\n",

    "In this Notebook, we first introduce more advanced classification\n",
    "techniques, including SGD, Linear SVC, and Logistic Regression. Next, we\n",
    "introduce the concept of token frequency as opposed to word occurrence as\n",
    "a basis for document classification, before introducing the concept of\n",
    "classification pipelines. Finally, we explore more advanced text\n",
    "processing and mining techniques including token clustering and\n",
