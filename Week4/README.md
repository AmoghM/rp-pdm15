# Practical Data Mining

Week 4: Introduction to Text Mining.

This week we introduce the concept of text mining, which builds on
previous weeks to classify documents by their textual content. We first
introduce the concept of tokenization that underlies the _bag of words_
approach. We use document tokens to construct a classification
vocabulary that can be further restricted either by total number of
features or in the number of consecutive words (or n-grams) used.
Finally we explore different classification algorithms and explore the
efficacy of these different techniques.
